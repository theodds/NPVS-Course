# NPVS-Course

Welcome! In this course, we will build up "spike-and-slab" type priors from linear models, to generalized additive models (GAMs), to nonlinear nonadditive models. 

Slides and code will be stored in this repository for you to follow along.

- `R` code for model selection with spike-and-slab priors is given in `SpikeSlabExample.R`.
- Slides for the linear/additive/non-BART models is given in `HDbayesianModeling.pdf`.
- Materials for replicating the results from the BART part of the course are in the folder `BartMaterials/`. The idea is to start from the file `01-Install.R` and go in numerical order.
- Slides for the BART part of the course are in `TreeVarSel.pdf`.
